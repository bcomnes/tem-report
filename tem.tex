\section{Introduction} % Major section

This report will cover some basics concepts relating to \ac{stem} and \ac{edx}, as well as some simple analysis of data taken a student lab session at the \ac{cemn} at Portland State University on May 16, 2014.  Bright field \ac{stem} images, \ac{edx} data and point spectrum of the inspected sample are included.  The data was collected using a FEI Technai \ac{tem} and the accompanying AZtec EDS acquisition and analysis tool.

Spectrum analysis is performed using last available freely distributed version of Fityk\cite{ft}: v.1.2.9.  Additional work was performed to build newer versions of Fityk from source and add it to the Homebrew\cite{home} package manager for future convenience of other students and researches.


\section{\ac{stem} Fundamentals} % (fold)
\label{sec:stem}

\ac{stem} uses the formation of a fine point of electrons rastering across the sample to provide information about specific points of the specimen.  This allows for mapping of \ac{edx} to specific points of the sample as well as limiting radiation exposure to smaller well defined sections of the sample.  Scanning coils are used to horizontally scan the beam across the surface as apposed to pivoting around a point like you would find in an \ac{sem}.

Because \ac{stem} images are formed by a raster scan, instead of using lenses to form an image, we no longer have to worry about defects in our lenses which can cause issues like chromatic aberration in thick samples.  Magnification of \ac{stem} images are determined by scan geometry.  While \ac{stem} can provide better contrast, images tend to be noisier than \ac{tem} mode images.  \cite{tem}  

\ac{stem} can generate both bright field and dark field images.  \ac{stem} actually provides images with less noise and better contrast than \ac{tem} but at the cost of lower resolution.  This can be useful for thick or unstained samples which provide very little image details and require the higher contrast \ac{stem} provides.  \ac{stem} gives more flexibility over the contrast of images because it allows control over things like detector gain and contrast/brightness settings that are not available on the analog \ac{tem} screen  (however you can always digitalis images from the normal \ac{tem} mode and apply post processing to your images to enhance contrast).  

\section{\ac{edx} fundamentals} % (fold)
\label{sec:edx}

\ac{edx} allows for detection of the chemical composition of samples.  It can be used with \ac{stem} to map chemical composition to specific locations on the sample.  Electrons are a type of ionizing radiation, meaning, that it can cause inner shell electrons in the sample to be ejected, resulting in secondary signals that contain useful information.  \ac{edx} uses the secondary X-rays ejected due to \ac{tem} radiation to plot the characteristic peaks of the elements contained within a sample.   

\ac{edx} is a form of spectroscopy, so detects and distinguishes x-rays by their energy level.  This is critical for the function of \ac{edx} as the whole point is to determine chemical composition.  Typical detectors are made out of $Si(Li)$.

Spectra can be acquired in a few common ways.  Spot mode uses the \ac{tem} to collect spectra from one particular point or feature.  This method is basic and can be time consuming if you have to gather spectra from a wide area or set of features.  It is also subject to operator bias as you may fail to check certain sections of the sample that don't look interesting.   A variation of this method can be done as a line profile.  Dot mapping scans the sample and maps detections to the sample image for a given wavelength.  This method can be augmented with post processing to provide false coloring to the image.  Finally there is spectrum imaging that allows us to collect a full spectrum of x-rays at every pixel.  This, unsurprisingly, uses \ac{stem} mode.

It isn't a matter of simple detecting x-rays as there are all sorts of sources of background noise and other peaks that exist due to other phenomena.  Issues arise due to high voltage electrons in the illumination system that generate large does of undesired x-rays as well as to scattering off very thin samples.  One can also have issues with spurious x-rays, which are generated by the sample, but not from the desired region, showing up in the spectra.

\section{Data Analysis} % (fold)
\label{sec:data_analysis}

We collected bright field TEM images of a Iron Oxide ($Fe_3O_4$) particles coated with Silicon dioxide ($SiO_2$).  Additionally, we collected \ac{edx} spectrum information and mapped the location of these different elements using the AZtec software.  The data was explored in a limited manner use the Fityk software.  Unfortunately the \ac{stem} images were lost in the process of exporting data and cannot be included.

\subsection{TEM imaging} % (fold)
\label{sub:tem_imaging}

Bright field images of Iron Oxide particles coated with Silicon dioxide were taken.  \ac{tem} imaging consists of illuminating thin samples that are semi electron transparent with a focused electron beam to project an image of the sample onto a viewing screen or camera.

The images in Figure~\ref{fig:brightfield} show an incredible level of detail and magnification.  It is important to understand what you are looking at in order to properly interpret an image.  We are typically used seeing images of 3D objects reflecting light back into a detector (a camera or our eyes).  This is typical of a \ac{sem} image.  Remember that \ac{tem} images are 2D images of 3D objects generated by transmitting light through the sample (rather than off of it).  Take this into account when observing these details.

Some interesting features that are visible are the crystal lattice lines of the particle.  They are particular apparent in Figure~\ref{fig:zoom}.  Bringing the image into focus and then slightly out of focus provides the clearest image and level of contras needed to

\subsection{EDX Spectroscopy} % (fold)
\label{sub:edx_spectroscopy}

The \ac{edx} spectrum was collected of our sample using the AZtec software.  An image of this can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:aztec}.  This data was replotted and fitted in Fityk and is shown in in Figure~\ref{fig:fitk}.  

The two spectrum plots look very similar.  It seems like AZtec is doing some kind of post processing to the data.  The curve fit is generated automatically and the identification labels are conveniently applied for us.  The main difference between the two representations of the data is the peak missing around 0 in the AZtec plot, that is present in the Fityk plot.  I'm fairly sure this is a background signal that AZtec is suppressing.  We see a tall peak for $O$ next to a peak for $Fe$.  A close up of these peaks can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:cross} where fitting the data in Fityk shows a super position peak between these two main peaks.  Pretty great!  

There is a small peak identified by the AZtec software for $Cu$ next to these peaks, but this was barely visible.  Further on we see our $Si$ peak loud and clear

Further out on the spectra (Figure~\ref{fig:outer}) we see a strong peak and weaker peak for $Fe$ as well as a peak for $Cu$.  The $Cu$ peaks are expected as our sample holder is made out of copper so this accounts and confirms our preexisting understanding of the composition of our sample!

\section{Fityk Added to Homebrew} % (fold)
\label{sec:fityk_homebrew}

Upon discovering that newer Fityk versions were only offered as runnable binaries for paying subscribers that required a hefty fee, a simple \texttt{ruby} formula was submitted as a pull request to the Homebrew Science repository\cite{hbs}.  

Homebrew\cite{home} is a popular 3rd party package manager for Mac OS X that manages the building and installation of open source software packages.  Upon the writing of this paper, the pull request was waiting for approval discussions with maintainers about acceptance sounded positive\cite{fpr}.  This will allow others to simply install the latest version of Fityk from the command line by running \texttt{\$ brew install fityk}.  A formula for the Fityk dependency, \texttt{xylib}, was also submitted to the \texttt{homebrew-science} repository\cite{xpr}.
