Not really sure what happened with the formatting with that last email. 
Things got very messed up for some reason. So here it is again, 
hopefully in a less nonsensical way. 

This will be a quite application based report, in the sense that I have 
chosen to emphasize an analysis of the diffraction patterns that we 
acquired in class. Since you haven't had any practice at this yet, I 
found some good references for you to use, that should make the process 
as easy as possible (note that I didn't say easy). The objectives 
described below probably seem a bit intimidating at first, but aren't 
that bad with the proper tools. I will be happy to answer any 
questions.   
  
I have attached 4 diffraction ​patterns
 for you to include: 

 1. aluminum polycrystalline pattern using SAED setting 2, 
 2. aluminum polycrystalline pattern using SAED setting 3, 
 3. single-crystalline silicon pattern at one zone axis, 
 4. single-crystalline silicon pattern at another zone axis. 

 selected area diffraction

The there is also one HRTEM image of of the gold foil, and-by request-an 
image of the silicon Kikuchi pattern. ​The report should be written in article style ​
again, and should address the following issues:

1. ​A ​brief conceptual/theoretical description of diffraction pattern formation.    

Compare the pattern of image 1 to image 2, and explain the cause of the difference.

Measure the the d-spacing of the first 3 rings of image 2 and identify which plane 
is causing the formation of each ring. 

Identify which crystal plane of the silicon is perpendicular to the electron beam for 
image 3 and for image 4 (image 4 is tricky--make your best guess).​  

2. Measure and label the lattice spacing for one of the crystal planes 
visible in the gold HRTEM image and verify that it matches an acceptable 
value for gold.

You should be able to find very helpful information about the
[theory](http://www.doitpoms.ac.uk/tlplib/diffraction-patterns/index.php) for these things 
using this website. And a very helpful [visualization]( ) of 
the resulting diffraction pattern, for a particular crystal orientation of silicon, 
is available here. This will be very helpful for objective 4 above. ​

You will also need to download and install [ImageJ](http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/index.html), 
which is free and useful. The procedure for analyzing an image is as follows:  

1. Open the image in ImageJ
2. Draw a line carefully over the scalebar
3. Go the Analyze menu and select Set Scale...
4. Enter the scale bar magnitude into the known distance box
5. Change the Unit of length to 1/nm
6. Click OK
7. Draw a new line between two points that you would like to determine the distance between   

8. Go to the Analyze menu and select Measure   

9. Record the length value given (remember that it is in inverted nm)  

​For measuring the distance between lattice fringes, you likely want to 
measure several-say 10-and then divide your measurement by 10 to get a 
more accurate result. ​

It is often helpful to use the Plot Profile-also under Analyze-which 
shows you brightness of the pixels along your line as a function of 
distance. 

​This way you more easily count the number of planes your line has crossed. And 
you can also draw a line and make measurements within the the plot profile. 

For analyzing the polycrystalline samples, I've found that a more accurate 
measurement can be found by drawing a circle precisely over the ring 
that you are trying to measure instead drawing a line as in step 7. Then 
when you select Measure from the Analyze menu, you can find the radius 
of the ring using the Area value that is given.

This site has [crystal information](http://rruff.geo.arizona.edu/AMS/amcsd.php) 
that you will need. The data from these types of databases is typically from x-ray 
diffraction measurements, so some things are irrelevant to us​, but will also have very 
accurate lattice spacing information.For example, to find the lattice spacing information 
for silicon, type silicon into the "Mineral" field and click Search. Look through the 
descriptions to find one that sounds applicable to your sample. Once
 you choose which file you want to use (most of them are very similar to
 each other), find the line that says "Download diffraction data" and 
click on "view text file." The useful information for you will be the 
D-Spacing column and the H K L columns, which tells you, for example, 
that the spacing between the (1 1 1) planes of aluminum is 2.3333 
angstrom. 

Ok, so that was a report in
 itself, so I'm going let you have a go at it from here, and you can 
send me questions where things are unclear.   

Good luck,

Si​mon



Hey guys,
It sounds like you guys need a little more time to work on the 3rd report. Go ahead and 
take until Monday to turn it in. And if you aren't sure about the expectations, please ask 
me questions via email. I will be out of town over the weekend though, so ask sooner rather 
than later. 

> I
 understand that we are using Bragg's law to determine the d spacing, 
though I might have either missed this in lab or lecture, but when you 
say which plane is determining the diffraction patter, what do you mean 
by "which" plane? are they assigned names? if so where could I look up 
this information?

Essentially
 this means "which plane is perpendicular to the beam?" or "what zone 
axis are we on?" Play around with the animation on [this](http://newton.umsl.edu/run//nano/reltutor2.html)
 page. So for instance when you look at the <111>; view, we are on 
the <111>; zone axis, meaning that the <111>; plane has been 
aligned perpendicular to the beam. All I really expect you to do is use 
the visualization -that I sent before- to determine, by observation, 
which zone axis creates the pattern that we collected in class. And of 
course, give some explanation for why you chose the one you did. 

> Furthermore,
 would you be able to direct me to where I can read up on how to 
determine the alignment of the lattice planes relative to the incident 
beam?

This [site](http://www.matter.org.uk/diffraction/) also has some good material, including examples and 
simulations. The only way to really confirm the alignment of the beam is
 to index the diffraction pattern. Once you've done that you can find 
the zone axis of taking a cross product of any two reciprocal lattice 
vectors. However, I was not expecting you to go that far. I just expect 
you to rotate and tilt the pattern until the simulated pattern matches 
one we imaged. That is I wanted you to play around with it, and just get
 familiarized with the topic and the terms that are being used- not 
necessarily write a thesis on diffraction patterns. 

> In
 the coneptual/theoretical section would you like us to go into Ewald 
spheres and Laue zones? It seemed like these concepts would be too deep 
for a "brief description of diffraction" but I wanted to check in before
 excluding them from my report.

No

just stick to main concepts. I'd like to see a pretty practical 
approach here. You don't need to go into all the intricacies. More depth 
and less breadth.

Parallel rays are focused into a point in the bfp by the objective lens.

the reflection method allows you to see the chemical differences in certain samples

diffraction contrast (removing parts of the sample forming an imagez)
thickness contrast affects the phase most.  ammount of atoms in actial specimin
mass contrast (scattering)  the higher z (mass of nucleas) higher prob of scatter
phase contrast

enhanced thickness, but also magnetic domains kind of like loranze

in situ tem (watching things happen in the tem)

easiest way is just heating and cooling a sample and watching it.

its hard because the holder is difficult to create and its also hard to get a camera capable of doing the right thing.


What to know for the practical:

basic alignment
imaging
stem mode
 - we create a point and use the deflection coils to move the beam around.  
edx spectroscopy
aperatures
  - c1 - condenser 1 below c1 lens that controlls spot size.  High spot szie beam is spread out low intensity.  1st aperature and its main function is to cut off the electrons that are incoherent.  We want the electrons in the center of the beam and cut off all the others.  
  - c2 - mostly for controling brightness.  diffreaction patterns you dont want a high c2 setting because the points are so intense.  more brightness is good for imagaing though.
  - objective - first form a diffrection, then use objectie app to pick a point to form an image.  used for doing high resolution stuff like lattice fringes.  increases contrast in our image.
  - SAED - opposite of objective.  its im the image plane.  we find our image and we see the saed in our image.  we choose a spot in our image to create our diffraction pattern.  
bright/dark/full

selecting the center bright point, is the bright point and give is the bright field.  everything else is darkfield.

diffraction
 - xyz axis
 say we have a 100 plane, its going to cross the x axis at 1, 0 at y and z.

 parallel beams due to brag condition focused to diffraction points to create a pattern

 tilting the sample moves the pattern
